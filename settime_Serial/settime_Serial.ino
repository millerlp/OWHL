/*	settimeSerial.ino
	Use this to get your real time clock date and time values
	synchronized closely.
	Copyright Luke Miller 2015
	
	To use this program, upload it to your board, then open the
	serial monitor at 57600 baud. Make sure the serial monitor 
	is set to send a 'newline' when you hit return (see the 
	menu in the lower right of the Arduino serial monitor window)
	
	You will be prompted to enter a date and time in the format:
			YYYY MM DD HH MM SS
	using 24hr time format.
	For example, July 8, 2015 at 3:12:30 PM (afternoon) would 
	be entered as:
	2015 7 8 15 12 30
	
	Type that in to the serial monitor window, then wait to hit
	Enter until you reach exactly that time. The new time will be
	uploaded immediately, and the result will be printed to the
	serial monitor. If you miss your time, you can enter a 
	new date and time in the same format and try again without
	needing to reboot. Generally it is recommended to set
	your time and date for the UTC time zone (a.k.a. Greenwich 
	Mean Time) for consistency and to avoid nasty issues with 
	time zone conversions and daylight savings time changes
	during subsequent data analysis.
